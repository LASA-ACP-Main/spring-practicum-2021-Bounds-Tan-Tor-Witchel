**LockProgram**

This is the application that will actually run on the raspberry pi. It will read input from 3 files (one for the RFID scanner, one for the keypad, and one for management).

**LockSimulation**

This is a simulation of all of the hardware and software in one spot. It is imperfect but is a good place to test data structures.

**OTPGenerator***

This is an app that will generate an OTP code which will match the code generated by either lock program. It will output the code and copy it to your clipboard (if you are on windows)

**Python Scripts**

These are a series of short python scripts which control the hardware. They are mainly for testing the hardware, but may be used to trigger certain aspects of the hardware in the final version. Some of these will need to be running alongside the main program to actively read hardware and send its input to the files.

**TestingFileInOut**

This is a simple program that can be used to test simultaneous read / write to a given file by multiple programs. This system will be used to transfer data between the python layer and the c++ layer.
